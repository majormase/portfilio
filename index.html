      <h4>You’re in the right place! I’m Mason. I’ve always had a knack for abstract meanings and functions in how people interact with art and tools.</h4>

<h4>After high school, I wanted a new perspective on life, so I journeyed to Sydney, Australia to begin my education in philosophy and psychology. After a year, I came home to continue my degree while working as a marketing logistics manager with The Kroger Company. My time there taught me leadership and team management. I soon finished my degree in philosophy at FCU and began my tech journey at General Assembly.</h4>

<h4>After visiting many places and meeting many people, I’ve managed to create my personal life formula: fully invest in everything you do, walk humbly and have an attitude of thankfulness in every step along the way. Commitment to my axioms has pushed me to expand my love for technology, communication and people.</h4>

<h4>I’m always looking forward for new challenges and opportunities for growth, so don’t be hesitant about sending a message!</h4>

          <h2>favorite things</h2>
          <h4>My thoughts for this project revolved around daily usability. I knew i couldn't solve world hunger today, so what could I make that was do-able, stretch my design skills and use all uses of CRUD? A blog came to mind.</h4>

          <h4>The app uses all 7 restful routes and a "like" button. As for as UX, I wanted the feeling of open-mindedness and a quite place to unfold one's ideas.</h4>

          <h4>My design plans started early on. Last project, i overwhelmed myself with UX possibilities that I couldn't find a place to start. And because of it, I felt my project suffered. This time, I began with my root idea, the blog, and began to expand on that. What kind of experience did I was the user to have? From there, I chose my graphic art, then my color palette. I took time in researching, in both my personal anecdotes and bonified studies, how users interact with web pages. I learned pages should be centered around 3 basic colors, nav panels are naturally assumed to the right, and title bars should lead back to the homepage. A positive experience can be reduced to the most simple experience. Good UX should be intuitively understood rather than learned.  </h4>

          <h4>My code follows the 7 RESTFUL routes, as well as incorporates a "like" button. When the button is clicked, a like is pushdown down into the db. Each route intuitively interacts with each page for a seamless experience. </h4>

          <h4>I developed a book query app that, when a title is put into the search bar, a form will be submitted that responds with the book title, author, publishing house and a brief description of the book. The design is focused around utility and minimalism. </h4>

<h4>My inspiration was from Google's search page. The page is white space, a title, search bar and ancillary information in tabs about the page. I researched user-font reactions and color theory to best intrigue the user while keeping focus on the page's primary function. </h4>

<h4>The code is structured around the API as a center piece. When a form is submitted, the API responds with the desired information. A modal is attached later to offer a short inspirational quote and a brief description on how to operate the site.</h4>
